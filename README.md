# 02 Advanced CSS: Drew's Portfolio

Using CSS and what I have learned so far in coding Bootcamp, I built a webpage to showcase my portfolio thus far. 

# Nav Bar 

In my Nav Bar I have my name and navigation links to scroll to the appropriate sections of my portfolio webpage

# Subheader

The first element of the body contain's the subheader of the page called Parker's Portfolio with a nice blue Chevron background.

# Body - About Me

The 'About Me' section is a short blurb that talks about the creator's background.

# Body - Work

The 'Work' section contains items in the developer's portfolio with links to the user's work. These elements all contain shadowing effects, background photos, h2 and h3 headers. 

This section used special flex properties in order to showcase the cards in appropriate sizes depending on the viewport.

# Footer - Contact Me

The 'Contact Me' section contains all of the users various links to contact. I used special CSS flex direction properties in order to ensure the orderly view of these contact links.
